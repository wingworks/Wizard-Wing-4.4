## FAQ ##

**I want to save money and build the wing myself. How much can I save?**

You better get a used wing.

**May I sell the Wizard <product-type I made according to the plan in this project?**

No! You are only allowed to build them for your private use. See [copyright](https://github.com/wingworks/Wizard-Wing-4.4/#copyright)

**Does the wing perform just as well as a commercial wing?**

It depends. The big companies build lots of different prototypes before they sell the final product.
The performance of the Wizard wing depends also on the feedback of the DIY builders. The more feedback and improvements I get the better the wing gets.

**Is there a guarantee that my wing will work?**

No, there is no guarantee. The Wizard wing in general will work. But it's a DIY project and you do all the work yourself and i can't check the building quality (seams, used fabric etc.). 

**Where can I find the building instructions?**

[wingworks design website](http://www.wingworks-design.com)

**How quickly will I get an answer to my question or github issue?**

It depends. This project is my hobby project and whenever I find the time I will help you as quickly as possible.

**Why do you offer the kite and wing plans?**

I want to support all DIY makers who would like to build a wing. From my personal experience I know how difficult it is to find helpful information or working designs. I had to develop my own kite and wing CAD software, build and test many prototypes.
Unfortunately my progress is limited by time and my home location (black forest). Anybody building one of the designs and sending me feedback helps to improve the project.

**I never used a sewing machine before. Can I sew a wing?**

It takes a lot of practice to sew a kite but yes it's possible after a couple of hours of practice with the different fabrics, seams, threads etc.

**Can I sew a wing with my household sewing machine?**

If it's a good and strong household sewing machine that is able to sew a zigzag or better the triple zigzag stitch it is possible to sew a small sized wing. I sew my first kite with a Pfaff 1222 and a couple of DIY builders reported that they used household sewing machines, too. But you are better off using your household sewing machine only for the sail and get a used industrial sewing machine with a servo motor for the stronger seams on the leading edge.
